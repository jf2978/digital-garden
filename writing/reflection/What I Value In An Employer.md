# Transparency
 - Why don't we talk about pay?
    - Heck, we should probably anonymize and make this data pseudo-public (for employees) so that pay inequities are less of an issue
 - If something happens in the news or on Blind, whatever -- why don't execs seem to respond to them?
    - Hard to tell if its a time restriction or a blatant negligence for the pervasive negativity that can really damage workplace culture

# Humane Leadership
 - stop using buzzwords and talking about business goals like everyone actually cares about them. Sharing success is beautiful, but after a certain point being obsessed with growth isn't all that necessary or even admirable.
 - letter to execs: share your vulnerabilities rather than your pitch decks -- not knowing is entirely normal, acting as if you always know is disingenuous. It may not always be "professional", but there's little need to read off of your notes like a well-oiled machine. Succinct clear business notes aren't what's interesting to the people you lead, empathy and resonating is

## Freedom to Grow (Beyond the Company)
 - "Growth" doesn't always mean staying at the company -- while it makes total sense for company advocates to think of all the great opportunities at the company, it makes more sense for the individual (and I think they'll be moreover eternally grateful) if companies are honest when that place just may not be a good fit
    - I think about my MC manager when I say this. They cared about me (my interests, my career, my well-being) before caring about my position (my tasks, promotion, etc.). Sometimes "best" for an employee is for them to no longer be an employee - and the company should __embrace__ that rather than fight it
    - e.g. Coinbase (at least in theory) talks about wanting to build a [culture of repeatable innovation](https://blog.coinbase.com/introducing-project-10-percent-building-a-culture-of-repeatable-innovation-at-coinbase-b66b8e9dc1d5) -- Coinbase employees can pitch ideas, try to make it within the company, and (if that's not possible but they still believe in the idea) invest in you.

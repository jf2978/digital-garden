Side thought:  "The knowledge-gap hypothesis: the concept that those who. already have the most capital in the broadest sense of the word (social network, affluent, etc.) historically learn about social/financial trends sooner and faster than those with less capital. As a technologist primarily surrounded by young, well-educated people who (more often than not) come from wealthier backgrounds, I see this every day. How can we ensure history doesn't repeat itself?"

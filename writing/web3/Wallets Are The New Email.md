Not sure where this idea will lead me, but felt and spark of inspiration that tries to draw a parallel between the way people fight against the security practices in crpyto (wallets, seed phrases, keys, etc.) and the way we might have viewed our current lives of passwords
    - we all probably have an average of hundreds of accounts (usually with repeated passwords)
    - we also probably have a few emails.
    
- If someone told you before email was even used very often, that you'd need to remember a password, log into this weird portal and people would send you mail whenever they want, you might be a little freaked out.
    - note: I'm sure there are some actual examples of this
    - Brooks mentioned it to Congress when he testified amongst other crypto CEOs -- law firms were apprehensive to the whole email transition, but imagine what it did for them once they embraced it

- The large thought I want to get across here is one that contextualizes change. We always think we are open minded, but at a certain point that just stops being the case (psychologically our brains "crystallize" as opposed to remaining plastic/flexible)
    - crypto skeptics are often nervous when it comes to these new hurdles (seed phrase, you can get hacked and your wallet drained, etc.), but I don't think that's enough to outweigh the benefits of this world

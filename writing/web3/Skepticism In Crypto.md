- This is something that just came to mind when reading through some of Stephen Diehl's thoughts in [[Web3 Is Bullshit]]
- I have a framework for understanding the differing levels of "trust" in the industry itself. 

## Crypto Evangelists 
### Revolutionaries
 - __Definition__
 - __My Thoughts__: I don't think crypto is going to solve any problems without introducing a new set of problems -- the hope is that the new set of problems is better than it was before. As with any solution, we are at best trading our current set of problems for another. Thinking cryptocurrencies will definitely fix the wealth gap, financial inclusion or racial inequalities is a pipe dream. This __isn't __ some technological revolution that'll only bring good things and get rid of bad things.
    
### Token Shillers 
 - __Definition__
 - __My Thoughts__: token shillers that only ever talk about markets going to the moon -- these guys are gamblers that realize their chances of winning in this young, FOMO-driven industry is all about exposure and take advantage of those looking to make their nut.
    - __Side Note__: Call it unfair to put these guys in the same category as those that try to talk more deeply about socio-political or economic concepts, but the reality that there's no evidence that points to the contrary that'll change their mind is the same. It's a dangerous mindset either way

## Crypto Optimists

### Decentralization Isn't Novel, But Built-In Network Incentives Are
 - __Definition__
 - __My Thoughts__: A fascinating and powerful property of these token economies is a networks potential for [[Redirecting Greed]]
 - mining isn't the be-all-end-all. Different consensus mechanisms optimize for different things and can in reality have a smaller footprint than the environmental damage that existing financial institutions already do
 - Take POS as an example (one of the more popular mechanisms today...)

### Tokenized Assets Can Create Mini Economies
- Interdependent Mini-Economies

### Web3 Doesn't Necessarily Replace Web2
 - [[Web3 Will Not Replace Web2]] -> we don't have to use blockchain for everything and I think long-term this will be the approach most will take. Technical limitations make total sense,

### Not Everyone Is Just In It For the Money
 - truthfully though, this is mostly a fair point. These folks are rare in the space. Heck I definitely got into this from the perspective of financial gain. However, I stay in the space because of the strong belief I have in the value this can bring people

## Crypto Skeptics

### Environmental Concerns
 - __Definition__
 - Mining and all this decentralized computing is hurting our planet

### Crypto Tokens Are Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes

### Blockchains Have Insurmountable Technical Limitations / Web3 Is Just a "Shiny New Toy":
 - __Definition__: i.e. blockchain trilemma,  expensive gas fees pricing out most people, transactions are slow

### Everyone In the Space Is Just Trying To Get Rich 
- 
## Crypto Fearfuls
- 
### It's the 2018 ICO Craze All Over Again
- 
### Stablecoins Are Backed By Air & Used To Manipulate Markets
- 
### Crypto Is Primarily Used For Crime

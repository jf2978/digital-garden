## Initial Thoughts
 - I've been looking for someone working on this slice of digital ownership since I've talked with Jesse and Geoff! A community focused creator economy that understands the importance of this space as a wealth creation vehicle. re: The ownership economy incentivizes wealth creation over expenditure
 - > Build a custom web3-native home for your community, powered by your social token & NFTs
    - I think their emphasis on enabling mini web3-powered economies (i.e. each creator having their own personal bonfire of sorts I guess) is awesome.
    - Even more important though is the what I assume are the principles that they're trying to embody -- no code, connect your domain, bring your own tokens. They're seeking to create a bridge between worlds rather than create a separate bubble
 	   - I'm on board with this 100%. It seeks to help actual people / communities that exist now at the end of the day, rather than helping a newly constructed community (web3 serving web3)
 	   - I'd love to pick the founders' brains and learn more about this stuff

## [My Background](https://jf2978.github.io/resume)
### Engineering
 - Previous experience building with Go, React, Gatsby (GraphQL)
 - [[Running My Own ETH2 Validator Node]]

### Thinking
 - This isn't really a job qualification, but something worth highlighting as a skill especially for early-stage startups looking for someone who's looking for more than just a job. A generalist, fast-learner, and responsible in the sense of taking lots of ownership over the code I write and words I write
 - Also [[Second Generation (Newsletter)]] with respect to showcasing some of that self-driven / curious thinking in action

### Investing
 - Nowadays, everyone is a creator. In the world of the ownership economy, everyone will be an investor too. The topic of investing is deeply personal to me and I have a passion for seeing a world where building wealth is normal again (rather than being shut behind gated games for the already rich/powerful)

## How I Can Help *Right Now*
 - I can code and I learn fast. All I need is a problem and starting point. 
 - I can also write. I may not be a leading web3 "thinkfluencer" on twitter, but I do think deeply about ownership (what it means in web3) and wealth and have written about it elsewhere, see:
    - [[Second Generation (Newsletter)]] <-- where I've written about finance
    - [[Redefining Ownership]]  <-- my half-baked thoughts on bay-area equity-as-compensation-packages and how it could be better in web3
    - [[Jeff <> Jesse]] <-- a one-pager I prepped before chatting with Jesse from Variant

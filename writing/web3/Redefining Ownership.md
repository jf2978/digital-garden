- probably want to do finish writing this after I leave MC

### Introduction
 - Me: jeff, mirror debut, some dude from BK grew up in a working class family, made it to break into tech as an engineer, and really just getting started in my journey within web3
 - Purpose: I don't really intend to become a writer. I just have thoughts and see its importance in today's society overwhelmed by information and primarily driven by opinions that gain traction on the internet (or better or worse). I hope to be additive to the conversation rather than destructive.

### Mailchimp
 - What my experience was like and why I left
    - I won't pretend to know how to run a business or really blame Ben Chestnut & Dan K. for making the decisions they did. Part of being a leader is having to make decisions for problems with no clear solution -- there were tradeoffs to what they chose, I disagree, so I left. 
    - By and large the acquisition was really just the tipping point for me. I was a part of a wonderful, welcoming, and all-around cool team. Frankly, I was already considering leaving the company as the red flags become clearer to me
    - I think MC will suffer greatly in the short term, but organizations evolve and I can only wish the company the best. Despite reading what's on blind, there is no "us" vs. "them" and there's no real guarantee that you wouldn't have done the same in their shoes.
 - What it stood for in the tech industry
    - bootstrapped successful startup; sells at an amazing valuation without going through VC hoops
    - VC hoops are commonplace in Silicon Valley -- funding rounds chip away at equity, going "public" . Mailchimp touted a number of differences
 - How the acquisition affected morale and image of leadership
    - Sure it was an organization with it's own set of problems, but the foundation was fragile. They talked about family, depended heavily on generosity for their compensation (which they absolutely were), which backfired when a controversial decision to sell (that obviously was a decision really only for the founders / leadership to make)
    - Messy acquisitions also happen, and honestly I don't think it was anything more than a bunch of the existing problems / red flags reaching a critical mass. 
 	   - The organization's fragile bridge between employees and "leadership", the reinforcement of the family mindset among team members during all-hands, the unwillingness to wholeheartedly admit they were wrong and embrace change, etc.
 		   - Not to mention the kelly ellis / controversial articles was actually all happening while acquisition talks were probably underway?
    - the constant dependence on throwing money at their problems
 	   - hiring consultants / contractors rather than investing in peeps internally makes me think they were hoping to throw money at organization-wide. (re: people) problems
 	   - the constant seeking for that next S curve -- hoping that the next inflection point would enable them to outrun their problems; underestimating the reality of compounding problems

# The Working Class
- this is a deeply personal question for me and one I tend to lean on socioeconomic diversity for; all in all, it comes down to recognizing the knowledge-gap hypothesis
- The "working class" is a loosely defined group of people and extremely politically charged... For my purposes, I really just want define this from the ground up (first principles?) alongside some intentional robust research... I'll mention the former instantiations of the term after that...

	- [[Competence, Relatedness, and Autonomy in Life Stories]] -- life stories are not only crucial to  but their limits when used by others. I want people to understand why we ought not to speak for others, especially those we don't have actual first-hand experience understanding
	- -- for establishing the baseline idea that motivation needs to be conscious in order for them to derive meaning from actions

# Ownership

## Mental Models for Ownership
 - My [[Mental Models]] for ownership & callout where I'm informed by my background mainly.
 - Other ideas (e.g. ownerless-ness) that I'm exploring, but am not quite sure where I land on yet.

## The "Old Way" of Ownership of Work
 - re: [[Understanding Dialectical and Historical Materialism]] -- the ideas presented in techno-socialism need to be updated for the internet age and ask harder questions that have changed quite a bit since this notion of owning the "means of production" really started
    - What this means in the context of the internet age, gig economy, creator economy, etc.
- Web3 Principles
    - [[The Ideas We Lose - Funding Scientific Citations through an NFT SplitStream]] -- an exciting potential avenue for me. to explore when citing all of the above
    - What does ownership mean -- address Marxist "owning means of production", but ultimately have a short but precise definition of what I mean when I say I own the value I create. It means we don't have to drink the corporate kool aid while also still being able to make friends, learn from each other. That's the beauty of working on cool shit with other people
    - In the current top-down structure of companies, inequities exist with way too many variables a part of that equation. maybe people are racist? maybe extroversion is needed to

    - Perri: "this could've all been avoided if Intuit just gave people raises"
 - big ideas (my own concepts)
    - this makes me think about the importance of fleshing out [[Redirecting Greed]]  
 - primary sources (data, research papers)
    - [[What we do and donâ€™t know: a meta-analysis of the knowledge gap hypothesis]] -- what does sociological research say about how information spreads throughout a society? the knowledgeable tend to run tight circles and are always at an advantage
    - [[Self-determination Theory - When Mind Mediates Behavior]] -- meaningful/fast spread of information beyond the rigid infrastructure (re: government programs, etc.) we set up in our societies requires two-way participation -- otherwise this redefinition, and will fall on deaf ears, or worse, in an echo chamber of the self-fulfilling intellectualization that is rampant within social media politics today.

##  Open Questions
 - would people on crypto twitter be willing to share more about their upbringing / socioeconomic class? I can't help but suspect that most of the existing web3 thought leadership is coming from people who've already

    - ### Who is a part of the Rocket Pool team?
        - [David Rugendyke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-rugendyke-260a2a60/?originalSubdomain=au) -- Co-Founder / CTO

    - ### What key problem are they solving?
    - ### Do we need crypto/Web3 to solve this?
        - __Is a self-serving ecosystem or does it bring value even to those outside of the industry?__
        - __How does this project leverage what a crypto token economy / web3 is uniquely-positioned to do?__

# Technical Due Diligence

**Key Advantages**:
        - Incentivizing infrastructure expertise while nominally lowering the ETH threshold needed to participate attracts high quality validators and bolsters the resilience of the system.
        - Investing in decent hardware requires upfront capital and implies a strong long-term commitment to an ecosystem in a competitive industry.
        - Learning and troubleshooting alongside an active community creates a sense of comradery among participants and core contributors. RPL incentives could be used to attract liquid stakers as well in the future.
    - ### System Design
        - __high-level diagram of the network__
    - ### Progressive Decentralization
        - **Product Market Fit:** __have they pinpointed their user base and MVP business model enough to prove the value they're bringing people?__
        - **Community Participation (Incentive Alignment At Scale):** __(TBD follow up reading) __
        - **Sufficient Decentralization: **: Can this token be considered a security?
    - ### How "ETH2" Shifts The Landscape
    - ### Token Economics
        - **Why 16 ETH?**
        - **Utility Flywheel**
            - __what value does it bring me as a **consumer **of this app/product/service?__
            - what resource (time, capital, skills, etc.) can I **provide** to the ecosystem and what do I get in return?
            - what value does the token asset
        - **Monetary Policy & Governance**
            - __Are there any inflationary/deflationary pressures that affect token price?__
            - __How do total/circulating supply & the token vesting schedule (if any) affect the asset?__
            - __How do they think about governing the protocol?__
- # Costs & Risks
    - ### Operational Costs & Revenue Streams
    - ### Technological Risk
        - __Any smart contract or oracle risks that exist within the system?__
    - ### Political/Regulatory/Legal Risk
        - __Can this be outlawed/regulated out of existence? Why or why not?__
        - __Tax implications for consuming/providing/holding the token?__
    - ### Environmental/Social Risk
        - __ Are there negative environmental impacts associated with the system?__
        - __ Any risks that come with potential bad press, negative social perceptions, etc.?__
    - ### Competition
        - __With new tokens created everyday, and fork-able open source code, what keeps people in this particular ecosystem over another?__

This page is meant to capture my recruiting angst -- not sure what I want, but know that I want something different. Instead of just trying to hop to the next best thing (or the opposite and ignoring all the emails/DMs I get about potential opportunities), I want to be more **intentional **and **honest **with myself and really ask: Why the fuck do I even want to change jobs?

##  "Why X Company?"
 - My answer should be the same no matter where I interview because my criteria should come from __me __not the careers Kool-aid every company will whip up

## What's My Story (Career Edition)
 - People and our identities are obviously more complex/nuanced than our jobs -- so I'm not really a fan of the question "what do you do?" when meeting someone for the first time -- BUT I think we'd be lying to ourselves if we didn't admit that we spend a lot of our time working (whatever that may look like for us).
    - To me, this necessitates us to take what we do very intentionally. It does not (and I don't think should) need to be tied to our identities, but we all have limited time on this Earth and living __unintentionally__ feels like we're not appreciating the gift of life and the guarantee-less-ness (lol) of it
 -  So this all still begs the important-but-precise question: what kind of engineer am I and how does that tie back to [[My Superpower]]

## [[What I Value In An Employer]]

## Questions I Have For Them
 - Drawing from all the above points I want to filter out companies that may not align with me on certain parts, having really intentional questions (and not just asking to brown-nose companies) will help me and maybe even give me the confidence to treat interviews more like the two-way street that they are!
 - How does mission/ambition/small teams/etc. manifest itself in your day to day? What does "work-life balance" mean to the people that work there?
    - This question is especially good to sus out unhealthy startup hustle culture where you're probably working 70-80 work weeks

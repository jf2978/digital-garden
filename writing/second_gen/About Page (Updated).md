## Hey, I’m Jeff 👋🏼
I'm a first-generation college graduate and software engineer turned personal finance nerd.

## My Story (So Far)
Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York by Dominican immigrant parents, I was taught that life was simple: get an education, land a good job and buy a house. Bam, all of life's problems are solved 🎉

So I studied hard, got into college despite not knowing what being "[first-generation-low-income](https://www.questbridge.org/)" meant, stumbled into the world of Software Engineering and [bought myself an apartment](https://www.secondgen.co/p/a-quick-update-from-me) at 24.

Honestly, college kinda sucked, but this moment with my parents made it absolutely worth it.

Yet I still have so many unanswered questions:

*What do I really value? What if I don't love my "good job"? How do I support my parents while giving myself the space I need to write my own story?*

## The Next Chapter
While everyone’s answers are different, I truly believe that *understanding wealth and how to build it, will give us the power to forge a future in accordance with our values.*

[Second Generation](http://www.secondgen.co/) aims to capture my evolving thoughts on wealth from the perspective of a first-generation college graduate. This could range anywhere from developing personal finance habits to conceptual breakdowns of [how money works](https://www.secondgen.co/p/money-flows) and discussing the potential for cryptocurrencies as decentralized financial infrastructure.

If any of that sounds interesting to you, I hope you’ll join me on this journey.

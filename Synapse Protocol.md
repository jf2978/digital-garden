> The Synapse network is secured by cross-chain [multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) (MPC) validators operating with [threshold signature schemes](https://github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib) (TSS)

### Technicalities broken down 
 - **Multi-Party Computation** is the theoretical foundation that solves the [[Millionaire's Problem]] more generally. It's goal is to protect the privacy between participants trying to collaboratively solve a problem (giving multiple inputs of information from many sources), while still producing a correct output
 - **Threshold Signature Schemes** are the basis for enabling digital signature generation from that incorporate multiple parties such that a predefined subset of parties (m of n) are needed to generate and sign such transactions. Verifying the signatures actually stays the same.
 - A good breakdown of these concepts and primer for how they connect is linked [here](https://www.unboundsecurity.com/blog/threshold-signature-schemes/)

### In plain English
 - Synapse is a network of networks - effectively connecting Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimism, etc. with each other that enables interoperable liquidity

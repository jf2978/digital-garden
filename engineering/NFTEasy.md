# Lesson 1
 - the tools we use (or choose to use) is often understated â€” any builder has strong opinions for these
 - Git and its history gives us a lot of insight about crypto
    - git commit trees are basically merkle trees â€” changing the code in one commit will change the hash and the ones after
    - in some way git is the first primitive blockchain
    - people say IPFS was awesome because of having the data being "content-addressable", but git has had that since 2005
    - blockchain isn't actually new technology
    - the whole point of this is to differentiate between "easy" â€” it means near to you (like within grasp) and "simple" which ultimately means "fewtwists" which is more related to "complex" which means "many twists" (lots of nuances)
 	   - so "easy" meaning its within reach
 - Node
    - the javascript runtime environment â€” takes JS out of the browser and into its own process (JS no longer lives in script tags)
 - Hardhat
    - previously it was really hard to develop for Ethereum â€” it basically only talks hexadecimal
    - truffle presented a framework where you can compile, run, test and debug your smart contracts
 	   - then it became very biased towards specific frontend frameworks
    - they needed to be highly opinionated in the beginning (truffle & embark), started moving away from
    - hardhat is somewhat of the standard framework-agnostic tool â€” no assumptions made for frontend and instead built a community around plugins.
    - if you're wondering about how to build communities, it's really about having this open architecture and we're really clear about how to add to it, to collectively contribute
    - Andy: in my opinion, community starts here (at the engineering, open-source level)
    - Q: where does the name hardhat come from? bitcoin â†’ "hodl", ethereum has "buidl" and it seems to come from that meme factor (plus constructor workers wear hardhats to build safely and hardhat's intention is the same: "to give a safe environment to build on ethereum")
 - on Linux...
    - each OS made some very specific choices that empower and limit people that use them
    - they are nuanced and complex, but the link makes you think about the importance of these deep, low-level decisions

 - interesting links dropped in chat (primarily for understanding history & context)

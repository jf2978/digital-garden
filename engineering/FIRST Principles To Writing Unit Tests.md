    - **Fast**: does not talk to a network (those are integration tests), and should verify one specific task quickly
    - **Independent**: unit tests should be totally isolated from other tests and dependencies should be stubbed/mocked so as to only demonstrate/verify the task at hand
    - Repeatable: pretty self-explanatory
    - **Self-Validating**: no need to verify anything after a test is run. Tests should themselves assert and give a conclusive pass/fail
    - **Thorough (or Timely)**: Thorough because we shouldn't just test the happy path. Timely because tests should be written alongside the new feature implementation itself to help ensure confidence with each push

> And while the results thus far have been jaw-dropping, you don’t have to
 squint too hard to see that much of what’s driving these outcomes is 
unfettered speculation more than any form of real utility. And while a 
powerful tool when used appropriately, speculation alone is insufficient
 to create long-lasting communities. Today we're seeing communities 
built primarily on hype and FOMO, with vague assurances of __future__ utility

 - absolutely agree and I appreciate the guts to calling this out in the space. I'm all for the potential these token-powered "mini economies". It's definitely exciting. BUT in order to actually start seeing the space grow beyond rampant speculation, we need to put real-world value into the hands of people
    - right now, in my opinion, the biggest thing **web3 is missing is a shared understanding of its value proposition for every day people**

> **To create healthy and lasting communities, we need more ways 
to earn membership and ownership in communities, and a greater focus on 
real utility.**

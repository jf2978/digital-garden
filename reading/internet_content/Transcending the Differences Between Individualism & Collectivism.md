- ## Notes
    - Macro view: The "internet of jobs" is happening
        - The internet of information revolutionized everything in society that had to do with information. Every piece of information can now run along a computer network
        - > And I believe that the internet of value will do the same for anything that has to do with value transfer because we can now transfer value/scarcity along a computer network
        - People aren't focusing enough on Internet of Jobs -- what comes after DAOs
        - The internet of jobs can make web3 go mainstream -- most people don't think about investing when they think of their financial well-being; they think about their jobs
        - > You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.

-- Buckminster Fuller
        - > And that's our goal: to create more value for everyday members of society.  As opposed to the gig economy which sort of boxes people in in a race to the bottom; commodification of skillsets.

    - This mission is about talent.
        - The point of moonshot collective / gitcoin is to build a product suite that helps DAOs recruit, recognize, reward and retain talent.
    - What is the "coordination party kit" CPK
        - tip.party (example)
        - Now we're trying to get 
        - others: pay.party, https://grants.gtcdao.net, tokenstream.party
            - tokenstream blew my fucking mind. I'd heard of [[Superfluid]] and so the idea itself isn't really novel, but their use case is very tangible and the implementation is so clean.
        - Questions Break:
            - Community building analysis tools? Lots of the thinking around this is still very high level and no real analysis has been done on the nitty gritty
            - should we have standards? We still believe in decentralization, but I think the design space needs to be explored before we set standards
    - Individualism & Collectivism (separate talk)
        - basic definition on a high-level (spoiler alert: these two groups don't often agree)

        - What' especially interesting though is that they don't even agree about the definitions of each other.
            - > Individualists care about individual sovereignty and avoiding coercion; Collectivists care about the group good... I.e. for individualists the axis is sovereign vs not & for collectivists the axis is group good vs. individual good
        - Taxation is a great example:

        - And important here is the point tot understand a better way to disagree about this stuff -- at the end of the day, balance is what we both want

        - where we are and where we want to go

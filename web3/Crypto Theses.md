# Social Theses

### Incentivized Web Infrastructure 

Amazon famously solved their own infrastructure inefficiencies [out of necessity](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/) and only later realized that they could be the first to solve it for any future developer or internet business. Turns out people want to simplify their lives and Amazon massively benefits from [[economies of scale]].  See: [[Rocket Pool]]

This ethos that "managing servers is just a liability" still persists today e.g. Moxie Marlinspike in [[My first impressions of web3]], but with the rapidly growing web3 ecosystem, that notion feels a bit outdated. For decentralized systems, running/managing servers can now be assets **in and of themselves**. Open-source smart contract platforms -- and every web3 business -- rely on this economic truth (for better or worse).


### Redefining the "Digital Native"  
> How is Minecraft/Roblox/Fortnite/TikTok/Twitch different from their previous counterparts? 

First take answer: shorter entertainment bites, social connection embedded into the games, renewed emphasis on the "world-building". My guess is that the "metaverse" is going to be an increasingly intuitive way to interact with people in our everyday lives -- rather than something we have to "wrap our heads around".

Digital social connection will be more seamless than in-person meet ups. 

I do still err on the side of caution with respect to how "good" this is for people in general (remote work is already having us wake up to the existential pain of what work feels like without others).  **TBD**: more to unpack and think about here especially based what I learn and read from research papers like [[The Digital Self: Through the Looking Glass of Telecopresent Others]]

### An Alternative to the "American Dream"
Thinking about the digital asset space from the perspective of wealth building (as opposed to just price action) can be helpful in cutting through the financialization noise. 

On the one hand, the 24/7 market nature of crypto makes it a constant boom and bust that traditional finance is rightfully skeptical of. On the other, I think flattening cryptocurreny to just a new asset class actually misses the point.

A growing tech-savvy generation is looking for alternative paths to wealth. Real estate isn't necessarily attainable, savings rates are near 0, and institutional ties within financial markets are becoming increasingly obvious (and frankly functions more like a systematic advantage). All of a sudden, passively earning digital assets by running a server or owning parts of internet culture doesn't seem so bad.

From my view, cryptocurrencies are changing the game on multiple fronts:

1. **Tokenization**: Smart contract platforms like Ethereum have enabled us to move money on hyper-speed. It's doing to money what the internet did to information. and its potential is beyond what we can currently imagine. This is where most of the well-recognized "disruption" will happen -- take financial transactions that were previously inefficient or prone to human error (e.g. mortgages, donations) and create new markets powered by smart contracts (e.g. crowdfunding DAOs, carbon credits).
	1. *Open Questions*
			1. How do we translate real-world assets into digital ones? Depending on the extent to which we can "solve"[[ the orcale problem]], I think most things that *can* be tokenized, will be. see: [[Chainlink]]
			2. When *should* we tokenize assets and when is it going too far? This is an important philosophical/societal question that will slowly but surely unfold as the space evolves.
2. **Cultural Assets**: Plenty of NFTs are scams today, but dismissing them outright is a mistake. If anyone said they dreamed of making a living as a content creator, gamer, etc. in the early 2000s, they would've been laughed out of the room. Making a living as a member of small internet tribes (DAOs), boostrapping your creative career selling digital assets (NFTs / social tokens), or financializing your in-game goods (play-to-earn, NFTs again, etc.) are the new viable-but-uncomfy-for-the-previous-generation career paths. Before we had verifiable digital assets, the only way to invest/own a "cultural asset" was to buy art (which needless to say isn't exactly accessible) -- buying music from your favorite artist early on could now be an investment.
3. **Nation-State Independent Money**: The internet made information accessible across the connected world. Whether it was a Facebook group that powered a secret government protest, or access to books/articles/courses beyond what the country had available. Cryptocurrencies have a long road ahead of them when it comes to competing on the global stage, but it'll undoubtably

> **TL;DR** [[asset ownership]] has never been so accessible before.

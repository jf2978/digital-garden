- I think ENS has a ton of potential wide usage and can drive some cool adoption.
    - Personal website integration?
    - crypto-native messaging/payment platform? Like venmo or splitwise but paying each other in Ethereum L2 stablecoins. 
        - Tricky problem to solve here though is: how do we counterbalance the offputting nature of paying txn fees for transactions? Do we absorb the fees and find a way to pay for it? Would actually be nicer to use other blockchains that have much lower fees (UST, Stellar USDC), but that creates a whole new set of issues of trying to bridge ETH wallets -> other chains

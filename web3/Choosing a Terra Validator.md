- ## Resources
    - [Terra Cypher Hunter Profile (List of Portfolio + Investors)](https://www.cypherhunter.com/en/p/terra/)
        - side note: first time I'm stumbling on [[Cypher Hunter]] seems like a great resource to stay up to date with the craziness that is crypto outside of Twitter (jeez FINALLY)
    - [How to Pick a Validator In the Terra Ecosystem](https://mlolalime.medium.com/how-to-pick-a-validator-in-the-terra-luna-ecosystem-fce4c9ea7826)
    - [The State of Decentralization on Terra](https://medium.com/qi-capital/the-state-of-decentralization-on-terra-67eec84df36d)
- ## Notes
    - Can diversify delegation (spreads risk, helps contribute to multiple validators, etc.)
    - Found Terra Bites -- helpful content, solid commission, uptime and want to support them since they helped me

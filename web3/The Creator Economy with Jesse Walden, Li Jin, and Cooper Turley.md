- ## Notes
    - ### Definitions
        - **Question**: what does the "creator economy" mean?
        - > (Jesse) we are all creators on the internet.  that's the nature of the medium. Crypto is gonna change the game here
            - presumably because it'll enable us to dig deeper into what makes a "creator" and allow for a broader net for people looking to contribute
        - > (Li) the process and system by which user-generated content can make money. It's not new to crypto and we've seen experimentation in this space happen already as we've gone from ad revenue share, to donation system, patronage, tipping, crowdfunding, etc.
    - ### The Four Chapters of the Creator Economy
        - > I think there are actually four "acts" to the creator economy that we think of.
            - **Chapter I**: social networking, basic user-generated content. people only use the platforms to communicate their ideas. Naturally some voices are more prominent than others -- examples: facebook, myspace
            - **Chapter II**: these prominent voices start amassing influence and they found a way to monetize this influence (primarily through ads). This is great because they start getting paid, but in this scenario the brands are still where most of the value is getting funneled. Influencers are just a conduit. examples: Instagram
            - **Chapter III**: influencers realize they __are__ the business. They can build their own brand and people will happily pay them for their content. examples: substack, patreon
            - **Chapter IV**: "you are your own nation-state". You are a sovereign entity and can take both your content and followers anywhere you please. This is empowered by crypto because of its power to generate mini economies backed by communities. example: [[mirror.xyz]]
        - > (Jesse) and just to add onto that I think we can think of tokens in theses communities as little "packets" of value. It takes the Silicon Valley model of attracting the best engineers by offering them equity, and it makes it accessible
            - I think the "packets" analogy is interesting because I think he's trying to emphasize just how big a deal it is to have value be as readily transferable as packets of information on the internet. 
            - **In other words, the postal service -> email  ~= banks -> crypto wallets ~= creator platforms -> token-incentivized communities**
                - this analogy will be to keep in mind for when I want to write my investment case for [[Rocket Pool]]
    - ### If you are a creator-first company, your cap table should reflect that
        -  this was a tweet from Li Jin the podcasters wanted her to unpack
        - Li mentions the interesting irony of some of these not-so-creator-friendly platforms are sort of co-opting the creator empowerment movement because it's popular to. But she thinks if they were true to that sentiment, they'd be giving up ownership of the platform itself because without those top creators the platform wouldn't have half the success it has
        - > I think of the creator economy on spectrum:

**helping creators build an audience **(minimum creator-friendliness)**
** -->
**sharing ad revenue creators bring 
** --> 
**let the creators make their own product offering and empower them to sell
** --> 
**own a piece of the platform itself **(most creator-friendliness i.e. crypto)****
        - **Question**: what would you say are the "fundamentals" to identifying a company that is actually creator friendly?

            - economic profit sharing (equity)
            - having a say in policy-making (governance)
    - ### The Shrinking Middle Class (i.e. American Dream)
        - seems like the middle class is a meme at this point. Millennials+ just don't see the hard work -> buying a home trope to really have legs anymore. They're more into meme investing + crypto for that matter
        - > (Jesse) I think the big opportunity for crypto is to allow for wealth creation to be the default thing people are doing when they contribute to these ecosystems and platforms. Plus, ownership can be earned in even the tiniest amounts (as opposed to platforms maybe extending a sort of equity offering to only their biggest creators)
            - makes me feel really good to hear this personally and hopefully was well articulated in my context/doc [[Jeff <> Jesse]]
            - I'm weary of the possibility of this being a little bit of crypto-flavored Kool-aid in the same way that crypto skeptics talk about "decentralization" being this amorphous catch-all solution to society's problems. Technology in and of itself cannot solve human problems, they are tools and __how we use them __ ultimately reflects what we actually value.
                - i.e. bad people with powerful, innovative tools will still do bad things.

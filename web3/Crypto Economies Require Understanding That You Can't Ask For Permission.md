- I'm really interested in this concept of "asking for permission" from a socio-cultural perspective and how that interacts with race/ethnicity. There's something about growing up in a immigrant family that sort of instills the "mind your own business, keep your head down and do good work" kinda mindset
    - And while that sounds good in theory, it has to be a big contributing factor to the limitations we put on ourselves as hispanics, children of immigrants, etc.
    - It's something I think my brothers and I have all hard to unlearn based on what we heard growing up and I hear the opposite from my friends who grew up with Russian-Jewish parents. Not only is there no shame for asking for help, but "the world runs on favors". Being bold, getting what you want and never waiting for permission is a powerful mindset that especially helps from a career/financial perspective.

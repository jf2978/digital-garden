- # Why Did I DM You On Twitter
    - ### My growing interest in web3 is personal
        - I was born and raised by two working-class, Dominican immigrant parents. We had strong values rooted in the [American Dream](https://www.secondgen.co/p/figuring-out-what-we-value), but a myopic understanding of what it means (and takes) to be successful. 
        - I've witnessed and personally experienced the enormous weight that not only financial stress, but the lack of **knowledge and opportunity**, can have on life. The potential for crypto to revolutionize our financial system is obvious, but I think efforts that truly address that knowledge gap are mostly lacking. 
        - I want to change that.
    - ### The ownership economy incentivizes wealth creation over expenditure
        - A while back, I wrote a newsletter issue about [money flows](https://www.secondgen.co/p/money-flows) that outlined how I conceptualized money and wealth. 
            - **TL;DR**: People are what legitimize value. Money constantly moves between people and effectively acts as a language to communicate value. Wealth is about stake in the financial infrastructure by which money can move to, from and between people.
        - The way I see it, crypto/web3 will enable us to more closely tie our **participation ** in this financial network to the **stake** we have in the network itself. And, perhaps more importantly, there are no bounds to what "participation" looks like -- if people find it valuable, your contributions will be rewarded and the value of that reward (re: asset) compounds the more you contribute and invite others to do the same. 
            - Participation would no longer be solely about giving your time and/or money. Wealth creation would no longer be a mountain to climb, but a feature of this new system.
        - This is what the ownership economy is all about. 
    - ### Variant's mission resonates
        - Frankly, I'm not on Twitter too often and I reached out to you directly without thinking too much about follower count or trying to network for a job. I just resonated with Variant's mission, wanted to learn as much as possible and figured I'd shoot my shot, reach out to see if I could help!
            - I also later realized that you founded Mediachain which (fun fact) I tried applying to when I learned about blockchain and was extremely unqualified and in college
        - I'm relatively young and probably naive about some of these things (I'm not gonna act like I know it all). But I do know that I have the story, skills, and burning passion to learn quickly and get stuff done. 
        - I'm excited to chat.
- # How I Can Contribute
    - ### Technical Due Diligence
        - Sometimes I read technical whitepapers for fun. I find them both interesting and usually a solid indicator of a team's potential for technical innovation, ambitions, working style, etc. for my own investments. Doing this for promising new protocols sounds pretty awesome to me.
        - As a Software Engineer, being able to gauge the feasibility and complexities of a distributed system is what I do. It's never about finding a perfect solution and always about making the right tradeoffs at the right time. [Progressive decentralization](https://variant.fund/writing/progressive-decentralization-a-playbook-for-building) is a great example of this in action.
        - Moreover, I actively participate in token ecosystems and have some first-hand knowledge of how amazing they can be. I am a former [[KERNEL]] fellow (KB4), a [[Rocket Pool]] Node Operator and I've recently invested in a industrial-grade router to participate in the Helium Network's "proof-of-coverage". Though my interests realistically began in the realm of financial gain, I quickly realized I stumbled on something so much bigger.
    - ### Psychology x Sociology Research
        - Despite the cool tech, humans remain the constant in all of these systems. Our needs, biases, motivations and capacity to nurture relationships/community are all incredibly relevant to these projects. At the end of the day, we're not just writing code and talking to machines, but trying to reimagine our larger social incentive systems one small protocol at a time.
        - As student of psychology, I've built intuition about what makes some people tick and I'd love for the opportunity to do more of this. The existing product engineering paradigm I work in as a SWE seems to lack this as we think about "users" rather than people.
        - Some questions that I often think about that seem pretty relevant to web3 projects: 
            - **If we completely remove money from the equation, what's left?** While money is a powerful incentive to bootstrap human behavior, it's ultimately not a sticky one in a decently efficient, hyper-competitive market. **Why do people choose to stay in that community anyway?**
            - **What are the relationships between user <> core contributor <> asset? Are they sustainable?** Using a hypothetical social money protocol as an example, I think it's worth asking: Do creatives feel appreciated and valued using these tokens? Do fans (i.e. users) end up feeling closer to the creator and their work? And how are the core contributors communicating with both sides to shepherd this new community?
- # My Web3 Investment Research Framework
    - Something I've been interested in working on is identifying some of the key questions we can ask to determine whether or not a particular crypto/web3 project makes sense long term -- using both my technical knowledge about distributed systems and an understanding what makes people tick.
    - ## What is the underlying, uniquely-human need that motivates and fosters a sense of community?
        - **Self-determination theory**: Community-based assets should think about why it is that people are incentivized to do what they do. In particular, external rewards aren't the only factor for ultimate satisfaction. It's important to communicate the idea that our conscious motives (i.e. "I set out to do a specific thing") are what **__drove __** that external reward (i.e. token appreciation, a better ecosystem, etc.) and is what ultimately gives us meaningful satisfaction. Likewise, the community's ethos/environment is what'll help shape those goals/motives to begin with.

        - Storytelling and the need for meaning 
    - ## How are these needs informed by (and how do they contribute to) larger societal trends with technology?
        - **Telecopresence & Social Media**: Web2 has shaped how our cognitive "self" is formed, what is web3 capable of? How can we learn from our past missteps (e.g. social media's addictive presence) and do better?

    - ## How does this project leverage what the crypto token economy / web3 is uniquely-positioned to do?
        - I think it's important to recognize that we're never going to get to a point web3 completely replaces the existing web2 "free-with-ads" business model. Web3 enables tons of possibilities, primarily as a incredible new way to monetize the web, but it won't always fit the bill. 
            - I.e. We need to avoid the trap of: “If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail” where crypto/web3 is our shiny new tool that we're all so eager to use. 
            - Instead I think we should start by deeply understanding the unique capabilities of web3 __first__ and try to imagine what was never possible before. 
    - ## What about this team's ability to execute and/or implementation philosophy gives me confidence their vision will be realized?
        - This one is pretty self explanatory, but still important. Ideas are inspiring, but are nothing but dreams without execution. And by the same token, incredible teams are capable of bringing even the simplest (and least "sexy") idea to life. Gauging that balance is key.
- # Applying These Thoughts to Mirror
    - It's no real surprise that [[mirror.xyz]] is making waves and I was excited to see the Mirror was a part of Variant's portfolio.
    - Mirror seeks to address our need to "leave our mark", create content, share it with the world, etc., but that's not unique to web3. With respect to addressing an underlying human need & leveraging the unique characteristics of a crypto economy, Mirror brings is the tight knit sense of community and **legitimate, direct financial relationship** writers can have with their audience. Medium/Substack writers don't have that.
        - Mirror does this by making a [[Composable Writing Platform]] and leveraging [[Tokenized Crowdfunding]]. Fans want to show their support, writers want their ideas to be recognized -- let's find a way for both to get paid.
    - With respect to larger technology trends, we've seen full-time web2 content creators need to cater to "the algorithm" as this black-box recommendation engine that determines whether or not people will engage with their content. It's problematic both from the content creators perspective (their creativity is stifled so that they can keep making a living) and from a societal perspective (why should product/engineering teams at these companies have that much power given algorithms can be biased?).
        - I'm not too sure if Mirror has implemented ways to directly address this, and most writers on mirror may actually depend on twitter for discovery sake, but it's definitely something that would entice creators to take the leap into web3.

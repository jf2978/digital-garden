# My "Pitch"
 engineer, known about crypto for a while, have dabbled in defi/contracts from an investor perspective and have the literacy to read contracts, etc. I reached out to you because Superfluid is dope (I wanna learn more), your name came up as a KB4 mentor and I probably want a new job soon (happy to contribute first and see where that takes us)
 
## Conversation Takeaways
 - About Superfluid (what it is, where the team is in terms of development)
    - Ultimately a token standard that makes crypto money stream-able -- we're starting with paying salaries in a more continuous manner (esp. for DAOs), but ultimately really want to enable developers
    - The "chicken/egg" problem that we have is that the competition is less-so another company, and more like fighting the existing comfortable mindset for the value of "constant, streaming value" vs. lump-sum payments
 	   - Going from focusing on salary payments / DAO treasuries -> empowering developers comes from the thesis that the relationship between the two is interlocked. In order for developers to want to build on top of the Superfluid ecosystem there needs to be a clear value prop for streaming money, but in order to get that from large enough groups of people, we need developers lol
 	   - In sum, Superfluid peeps are working to build the __intuition__ around streaming cashflows by focusing on the tangible benefits for it right now: 
 		   - paying people
 - How can I help (open-source, job opportunities, etc.)
    - bounties / hackathons

 	   - Can also try to contribute to Superfluid-based apps like https://www.ricochet.exchange/ (less bureaucratic, just jump into their discord and do stuff)

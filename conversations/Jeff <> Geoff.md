- Thinking more deeply about my mini thesis I wrote up for [[Jeff <> Jesse]], I want to capture some of my thoughts for this call ahead of time as well. 
    - Namely, why am I interested in working for Variant, what's my "vertical" in Web3 that I can focus on and be known for, and ultimately why am I interested in the investing side of things?
- # Who Am I
    - SWE, personal finance writer, investor on my own time, KERNEL KB4
- # Why Variant?
    - Put simply, it comes down to my belief in the value that the ownership economy thesis. And not just from the perspective of creators (i.e. let's look for a "web3 YouTube and give them NFTs"), but more so from the perspective of wealth creation.
    - Jesse made some really interesting points in [[The Creator Economy with Jesse Walden, Li Jin, and Cooper Turley]] with respect to what "ownership" means for the bolstering of the middle class that I really resonated with. I heard this after our own chat in The ownership economy incentivizes wealth creation over expenditure. I'm incredibly dedicated to this problem and want to push that narrative forward as much as possible
    - As for why "investing" as the means for doing so rather than continuing to build as an engineer, I think it comes down to a shift and alignment in my interests.
        - Wealth Creation e.g. [[Second Generation (Newsletter)]]
        - Broad "systems thinking", not limited to engineering e.g. [[Self-determination Theory: When Mind Mediates Behavior]]
        - Passion for working on the frontier rather than worry about organizational structure, engineering team dynamics, etc. like we always do at tech companies. Venture Capital is a far more interesting/exciting alternative
- # What Would I Implement As An Investment Researcher?
    - > Ideas and thoughts to support builders in the space?
        - Within the framework of [[Progressive Decentralization: A Playbook for Building Crypto Applications]], I think it depends on where the builders are in this journey
            - **Product Market Fit**: key here would be to lean into experimentation & commit when something sticks. As a builder myself, I understand how enticing it is to fall in love with your vision and initial ideas (it's a trap and I think hearing that from someone who also builds is important) 
            - **Community Participation / Sufficient Decentralization**: think of this in human terms not just economic ones -- the "token utility flywheel" as I call it, is as much about marketing/bootstrapping incentives as it is about the social community building that keeps people there rather than simply chasing yield between projects (and potentially having too many of those types of people)
                - __Factors to Consider In Token Price Estimate__: token utility flywheel (asset <> core contributor <> community member), vesting schedule (if other investors), supply mechanics (are tokens burned on transactions?)
    - > What's your personal brand and how will you think publicly?
        - **My Brand**: focus onn the ownership economy as a powerful wealth creation pipeline that's not just for the content creators of the world, but really anyone with a niche interest and dedication to contribute to (and effectively invest in) a community
        - **Public Thinking**: my digital garden (this) && [[Second Generation (Newsletter)]]
    - > What's your point of view about a specific investment category?
        - I think an investment category that hasn't been fully explored is stablecoin community arbitrage (a la stablecoins like UST/RSV that depend on arbitrage opportunities to stabilize the peg)
            - Example project: [[White Whale]]
        - The potential to turn "retail" investors into "whales" is a really powerful one that I think crypto token communities are perfect for, especially given what we've seen with GME
    - > How can you source investment opportunities through involvement?
        - My interest and involvement in [[Rocket Pool]] will only grow over time as I continue to run a node. Some things I've noticed
            - **Economic Needs**: ETH txn fees and their potential for cutting into staking profits
            - **Engineering Needs**: tooling is king -- good documentation is a large part of the reason why I joined them, they continue to make our lives easier to instrument, get visibility into our performance, optimization strategies, etc.
            - **Social (Knowledge Sharing) Needs**: community support as the backbone to get people to really do well (and ultimately join the community themselves)

    - Look into NFT platforms we talked about & differentiate them: [[Metaplex]] (the underlying NFT standard) and [[Holaplex]] (the Solana NFT storefront built on the former)

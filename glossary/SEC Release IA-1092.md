# Definition
 > a broadening interpretation of investment adviser to include financial planners, pension consultants, and others who offer investment advice as part of their financial practices.

## Financial Planners
 - FPs who make recommendations regarding a person's financial resources or perform analyses that concern securities are investment advisers if they do so as part of a business or for compensation

> Under this interpretation, the SEC holds that there is no such thing as a comprehensive financial plan that does not involve securities

## Pension Consultants
 - Consultants who advise employee benefit plans on how to fund their plans with securities are also considered IAs
 
## Sports and Entertainment Representatives
 - A person who provides financially related services to entertainers/athletes including advice on investing, tax planning, budgeting, and money management, etc. are considered IAs
 - **NOTE**: A sports agent who helps a player get a favorable contract and receives a commission for doing so isn't necessarily an investment adviser. If that person then turns around and tells the player what to do with their money -- e.g. to take their earnings and invest it -- __then__ they would be in the business of acting like an IA.

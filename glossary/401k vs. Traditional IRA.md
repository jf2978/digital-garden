## Notes
> A 401(k) allows for more money to be contributed each year on a pretax basis than an IRA. A 401(k) is also somewhat easier to manage for those who donâ€™t want to make investment decisions since the plan would likely offer mutual funds."
 
 - I'm thinking direct rollover to IRA is the way to go primarily because it offers more control & given I'll be moving over to another company, may actually help to have it in a platform I like. also Empower kinda sucks
 - The question I now have is Vanguard or Betterment? I have accounts with both
    - Betterment feels more digital-native-friendly, but has a higher fee
    - Is the tax loss harvesting benefit on Betterment even relevant here? **nope**
    -  What would i probably invest in when I do get control? probably vanguard etfs and funds

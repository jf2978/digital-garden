# Definition
> Economies of scale are the advantages that can sometimes occur as a  result of increasing the size of a business. For example, a business  might enjoy an economy of scale concerning its bulk purchasing. By  buying a large number of products at once, it could negotiate a lower  price per unit than its competitors.
	
> Larger companies can produce more by spreading the cost of production over a larger amount of goods

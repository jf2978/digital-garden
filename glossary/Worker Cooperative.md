# Definition
 > A **worker cooperative** is a [cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) [owned and self-managed by its workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management).
 
 > The philosophy that underpinned the cooperative movement stemmed from the [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) writings of thinkers including [Robert Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Owen) and [Charles Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fourier).
 Robert Owen, considered by many as the father of the cooperative 
movement, made his fortune in the cotton trade but believed in putting 
his workers in a good environment with access to education for 
themselves and their children. These ideas were put into effect 
successfully in the [cotton mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_mill) of [New Lanark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Lanark), [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland).

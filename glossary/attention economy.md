# Definition
> **Attention economics** is an approach to the management of information that treats human attention as a scarce commodity and applies [economic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_theory) to solve various information management problems.

> As content has grown increasingly abundant and immediately available, attention becomes the limiting factor. A strong trigger of this effect is that the mental capability of humans is limited and the receptiveness of information is hence limited as well. Attention allows information to be filtered such that the most important information can be extracted from the environment while irrelevant details are left out.
